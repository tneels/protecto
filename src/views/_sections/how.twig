                    <h3>Connected app and data analysis</h3> 
                    <p>Thanks to a connected technology, embedded, and at the forefront of electronics, the PROTECTONNECT cover, fitted with various sensors, is remotely controlled via a mobile application, allowing real-time detection of leaks and global monitoring consumption for smart cities.

                    <p>The customer is warned remotely by a "Water Leak Alert" via SMS or email. Once the customer receives the alert, he can either manage the leakage himself, or ask the PROTECTONNECT team to do it for him due to lack of knowledge, in the event of vacations or prolonged absence from the place of residence (holiday homes).
